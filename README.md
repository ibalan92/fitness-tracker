## Information
This website allows the user to track exercises and workouts.

The user is able to create workouts. Inside these workouts, the user can add multiple exercises, specifying the exercise name, number of sets completed, number of reps completed and the amount of weight used. Once the user has filled in all of these fields with valid input, the user can add the exercise to the workout. After the user has inputted all exercises, they can be downloaded to a JSON file. The user also has the option to add JSON files containing previous workouts to the downloaded JSON file.

Using this JSON file, the user can also view statistics from their workouts, such as the total number of workouts, the total number of exercises and graphs displaying other statistics.

The website also allows the user to search for nearby gyms. The user is asked to enter their location. All of the gyms within a 5 mile radius of that location are then shown to the user.
